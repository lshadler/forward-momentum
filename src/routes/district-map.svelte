<h1>District Map</h1>

<p>We have embedded a map from GovTrack in order to support clarity on who your representatives are. If you want a more accurate idea of what your representative is involved in, please do the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Locate your residence on the map</li>
    <li>Record the district that your residence falls within</li>
    <li>Go back to <a href=".">homepage</a> and select your state</li>
    <li>Search the house of representatives displayed within the page for your district representative</li>
</ul>
